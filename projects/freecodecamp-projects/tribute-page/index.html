        <h3>Malik(Malcolm) childhood experience</h3>
        <p>
          As a child Malcom was a brilliant and successful student in middle
          school, one day his english teacher Mr Ostrowski asked him what he
          want to be in the future. Malcolm responded that he wants to be a
          lawyer. Then Mr Ostrowski turn to Malcolm and says"You know,we all
          love you here. But you must not forget that you are a black person.
          Being a lawyer is not realistic ideal for a Negro.You should think of
          something you might be.You have very talented hands. Do not you think
          of being a carpenter?". Mr Ostrowski asked other students what they
          will choose as a job and encourage them to implement their ideals,
          even they were less hardworking than Malcolm. These and other scores
          of events alienate Malcom from the system and forced him to live on
          streets.
